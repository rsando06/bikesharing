# NYC City Bike

## Project Overview
This project is a visualization to see the viability of having a bike sharing program in Des Moines by using bike sharing data from New York City by using Tableau to make the data easy for investors to understand.

### Visualizations
#### Checkout Times for Users
![Checkout Times for Users](https://github.com/rsando06/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png?raw=true)
- The majority of the trips are under an hour, with the highest trip duration being five minutes.

#### Checkout Times by Genders
![Checkout Times by Genders](https://github.com/rsando06/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Genders.png?raw=true)
- This visualization further exemplifies how the trips are under an hour; however, now we see that the majority of the trips made are by males.

#### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://github.com/rsando06/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png?raw=true)
- There are higher rental spikes on the weekdays early in the morning and late in the afternoon.

#### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
![Trips by Gender(Weekday per Hour)](https://github.com/rsando06/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png?raw=true)
- There are more males who rent out bikes during the rental spikes shown in the previous visualization.

#### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/rsando06/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png?raw=true)
- There are more bikes rented out by males that are subscribers.

#### Customer Type
![Customer Type](https://github.com/rsando06/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Customer%20Type.png?raw=true)
- There are more subscribers than there are customers.

#### Top Starting Location
![Top Starting Location](https://github.com/rsando06/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Top%20Starting%20Locations.png?raw=true)
- There are more starting location in lower Manhattan.

## Summary
- There are higher bike rentals from males and from subscribers.
- There should be more advertisement for other genders to increase revenue.

One of two suggestions I have would be to visualize the starting and ending locations and whether or not the bikes are returned to their starting locations. This would help in finding out whether bikes would need to be moved to locations that need bikes. The second suggestion would be to visualize the usage of the bikes by age groups.
